This repository covers our team's work on validating the accuracy and error rates of multiple different positive-unlabeled learning models.
All of the models are also run against CatBoost which is "an open-source software library developed by Yandex. It provides a gradient boosting 
framework which among other features attempts to solve for Categorical features using a permutation driven alternative compared to the classical algorithm."
We used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that focused on students dropout rates compared to dozens of different factors.
This research addresses the critical challenge of predicting and identifying students at risk of academic dropout and failure in the early stages of their academic journey. 
Early detection enables proactive intervention, optimizing resource allocation and fostering the well-being of at-risk students. The project contributes actionable 
insights to inform decision-making for educators, administrators, and policymakers. We have also considered taking this project further by testing more methods and then
submitting our report to the upcoming 2024 ACM Conference.
